# Academic Declearation:
Your behaviour is violating the University's Non-tolerance Policy of Plagiarism.
I will report to the school and registry once I detect you since I have embeded some "magical" code,
which you cannot find with your limited knowledge.

BTW, I didn't get a good score with this code.

# one-line-editor
An editor enables you to edit the fucking in-line word by code.
What you should notice is that there's no space between cmd and text.

i.e.
```
>aHello World
Hello World
```
